 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>
    Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps us evaluate how efficient an algorithm is as the size of the input grows.
  </p>	
  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. For example, an algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input.
