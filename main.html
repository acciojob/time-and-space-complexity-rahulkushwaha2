	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p1>Time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases with input size. It helps in choosing the most efficient algorithm for solving problems. </p1>

	<p1><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as it runs. If an algorithm uses extra memory that grows linearly with input size, its space complexity is O(n).</p>
